        <h1>Happiness Index Information</h1>
        <p>
            The Happiness Index, also known as the World Happiness Report, is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. 
            It is calculated based on various factors that contribute to well-being, such as economic production, social support, 
            life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
            The index is calculated by surveying thousands of people from different countries and asking them to rate their 
            happiness on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest level of happiness. These ratings are then combined 
            with objective data to determine the overall happiness score for each country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, the trends in the Happiness Index have shown fluctuations influenced by various factors, including 
            economic conditions, political stability, social policies, and environmental factors. Understanding these trends 
            helps policymakers and researchers identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to enhance overall well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several factors contribute to the happiness index of the world. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GDP per capita</li>
            <li>Social support</li>
            <li>Healthy life expectancy</li>
            <li>Freedom to make life choices</li>
            <li>Generosity</li>
            <li>Perceptions of corruption</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's important to note that while economic factors like GDP per capita play a significant role in determining 
            happiness levels, social and environmental factors also contribute significantly. Countries with strong social 
            support systems, high levels of freedom, and low levels of corruption tend to have higher happiness scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, cultural factors and individual experiences can influence happiness levels within countries. 
            Therefore, addressing happiness requires a multifaceted approach that considers both macro-level policies 
            and individual well-being.
